# README `/secret`

To run these scripts, you will need:
1. an AIRNOW account and API key, saved as `AIRNOWKEY` in a `secret/.env` file (better)
2. an `AQIEMAIL` and `AQIKEY` in your `secret/.env` file from EPA AQI API. (historical)

```bash
AQIEMAIL=name@email.edu
AQIKEY=lalalalala
AIRNOWKEY=somethinghere
```
